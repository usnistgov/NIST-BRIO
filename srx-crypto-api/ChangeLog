===========================================================
Version 0.3.0.6 - July 2024
  - Fixed bug in deleting keys from key_storage
Version 0.3.0.5 - July 2024
  - Re-ran autoreconf to enable being compiled on Rocky 9
Version 0.3.0.4 - Oct 2021
  - Fixed spec file for rpm generation
Version 0.3.0.3 - May 2021
  - Moved the configuration from from hard coded to be a template
    file that is configured the build process. This allows to point
    to the proper key vault folder.
  - Properly deprecated option -t in crypto tester
Version 0.3.0.2 - March 2021
  - Updated project email address.
Version 0.3.0.1 - July 2020
  - Fixed errors in dates.
  - Updated email address
  - Updated spec file.
Version 0.3.0.0 - June 2020
  - !!! This version is not backwards compatible to V0.2 !!!
  - Fixed m4 scripts regarding OpenSSL header file location
  - Modified sign method parameters to allow signing more than one update 
    message digest. This allows to generate all signatures of an update required
    for each signature block at once.
  - Modified the data structure handed into the sign method to make it more 
    easy to understand. Removed ambiguous attribute declarations.
  - Added More documentation on how to use the API
  - Added more functionality
  - Removed all "merged" comments to make future merging easier
Version 0.2.0.7 - November 2018
  - Fixed OpenSSL deprecation issues (Needed for Ubuntu 18 platforms)
  - Added alternative library (.so) configuration in sample configuration
Version 0.2.0.6 - April 2018
  - Fixed incorrect entry in Changelog for 0.2.0.5
  - Fixed M4 Script for OpenSSL
Version 0.2.0.5 - October   2017
  - Added .a into configuration.
Version 0.2.0.4 - September 2017
  - Moved Version 0.2 into branch to be able to address 0.2 related bugs. This
    will include bugs of SCA 0.2 identified within trunk development of version 
    0.3 and later that might need addressing in version 0.2
  - Fixed some BUGS
Version 0.2.0.3 - July - 2017
  - Fixed some bugs
  - Added some defines to the header file
  - Added init string to test lib to allow some runtime debugging
  - Fixed default assignment if configuration method mapping is incomplete
Version 0.2.0.2 - November - 2016
  - Fixed some bugs
  - Added functionality to print bgpsec data using the testlib.
Version 0.2.0.1 - July - 2016
  - Bug fixes
Version 0.2.0.0 - May/June - 2016
  - Redesigned the API - This API is incompatible with any 0.1.x version.
    * Modified the key generation tools in such that they also generate the 
      key storage structure to be compatible with BIRD reference implementation.
    * All functions are mandatory to be implemented
    * Functions only return two values and more detailed information are 
      returned using a status flag.
    * Only one validate and one sign method - Keys are not passed anymore during
      the validation / sign call - requires pre-registration of keys.
    * API returns the validation hash as as the signature buffer. To free these
      allocated memory the API provides the appropriate free methods.
    * Added capability to set a debug level.
    * Removed requirement to generate API specific BGPSec Path data structure,
      validation will be performed on the BGPSEC path attribute as it is 
      specified in the bgpsec draft (future RFC).
  - Modules MUST provide key management (private / public).
  - API BGPSec_OpenSSL is rewritten to reflect the changes in digest generation 
    as well as API function changes. 
    * Internal key storage is rewritten and moved into its own source
Version 0.1.3.0 - March-April 2016
  - modified structure BGPSecKey to be packed
  - added prefix structure SCA_Prefix
Version 0.1.2.2 - March 2016
  - Modified memory management in sca_generateMSG1 and sca_generateMSG2 to 
    prevent a memory leak.
  - Added NULL check to srxCryptoUnbind
  - Modified configure.ac merging code to distinguish between 32 and 64 bit
Version 0.1.2.1 - January-March 2016
  - Added init method (missing in 0.1.2.0)
  - Fixed bugs
Version 0.1.2.0 - September-December 2015
  - Moved the installed libraries into lib/srx or lib64/srx. Same for the header
    file srxcryptoapi.h - It is not located in srx/srxcryptoapi.h
  - Changed --enable settings (testlib and bgpsec-openssl) to be --without 
    settings. Components are installed by default.
  - Added --without-la-lib which is used for RPM generation. This setting is 
    used in spec file %configure statement to not include .a and .la libraries
    in rpm file.
  _ Restructured initialization code
  - Removed term_debug and added sca_getCurrentLogLevel
  - Added configuration for key file extension for backwards compatibility
  - Modified the key generation to not only produce the PEM encoded key.
    Newly der encoded keys are stores and xxxxx.der
  - Use the DER encoded key rather than the PEM encoded one.
  - Added key storage to BGPSecOpenSSL implementation.
  - The verify and sign methods now take the DER encoded keys.
  _ Added functionality to NOT load functions the plugin reports as not 
    supported - regardless if they are configured or not.
    Example: !isExtended -> extValidate and all public key functions are not 
                            loaded
  - Modified the qsrx-xxx tools to only install keys not already installed.
    Kept backwards compatibility with key filenames. PEM=.key, DER=.der
    The PEM keys are used for srxCryptoAPI 0.1.1.1, all others will use the
    DER encoding.
Version 0.1.1.1 - Arpil 2015
  - Fixed bug in configuration that could cause memory issues
  - Fixed linking problems on Ubuntu systems
Version 0.1.1.0 - March 2015
  - Initial Release
