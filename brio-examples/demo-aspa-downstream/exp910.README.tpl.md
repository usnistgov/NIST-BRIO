# ASPA Upststeam Verification Example #910
This example contains examples #9 and #10 bundled in a single example.

## Introduction
This demo uses one BGP router instance under test (IUT) that must support ASPA 
processing, one BGP RPKI-IO (BRIO) traffic generators (brio_tg) and one BRIO 
RPKI Validation Cache Test Harness (brio_rc). 

All required files for this experiment have the prefix ```exp910.```

Three BGP UPDATEs are received from a customer or lateral peer. AS 65000 (A)
announces one prefix, 10.65.0.0/22 and AS 65020 (C) announces one prefix, 
10.65.20.0/22.  
```
65010 (B) <-- 65040 (E) <-- 65000 (A), 10.65.0.0/22
65010 (B) <-- 65040 (E) <-- 65000 (A) <-- 65020 (C), 10.65.20.0/22
```  

## System Requirements
For this example, three IP addresses are required. All three can be assigned to 
alias interfaces.  
IP-Address-1: {IP_AS_65010-910} (A) Used for IUT 
IP-Address-2: {IP_AS_65040-910} (C) Used for BRIO Traffic Generator (brio_tg) 
              and BRIO RPKI Cache (brio_rc)

## Topology
```                 
                    <-p2p->
                 [F].......(G) {AS0 ASPA}
       /|\       . .       . .
   C2P  |       .   .     .   .
        |      .     .   .     .
              .<-p2p->. .<-p2p->.
            (C).......(D).......[E]
       /|\   *.       .        :*  \

        |      *.   .        :*      \
                *. .        :*        \
                *(A)::::::::*         (B)
                *************

[E] and [F] have no ASPAs  
--/--\-- Updates are sent across this path
........ Link available and maybe used, maybe not, announcements are forged.

::: Forged Origin by E towards B
*** Forged Path by E towards B

| Label | Description                  | \| | Node | AS Number | Prefix*        |
| ----- | ---------------------------- | -- | :--: | :-------: | :-----------  |
| C2P   | Customer to Peer             | \| |  A   | AS 65000  | 10.65.0.0/22  |
| p2p   | Peer to Peer (lateral peers) | \| |  B   | AS 65010  | 10.65.10.0/22 |
| [X]   | Do not have ASPAs            | \| |  C   | AS 65020  | 10.65.20.0/22 |
|       |                              | \| |  D   | AS 65030  | 10.65.30.0/22 |

\* The prefixes above reference the range assigned to each AS and can be announced
as as full prefix and or sub-prefixes.
(E.g.: 10.65.0.0/22 can be announced as 10.65.0.0/23 and 10.65.2.0/23)

## Example Scenario
* B is the receiving/verifying AS (Implementation Under Test - IUT)
* B receives BGP updates from peer E with AS paths: 
  * E A
  * E C A
  (simplified to contain only unique ASes)
* AS path lengths = 2 and 3 respectively
* Using the given ASPAs and the method in Section 6.1 and procedure in 
  Section 6.3 of [[ASPA verification](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-sidrops-aspa-verification/)] ...
  * ... the max_up_ramp, min_up_ramp, max_down_ramp, and min_down_ramp values 
        can be retrieved from the table below.
  * ... the verification outcomes can be retrieved from the table below. 

* The forged-origin and forged-path-segment hijacks (path manipulations) by 
  provider AS 65040 (E) towards customer AS 65010 (B) are undetectable by ASPA.
  For more information see ASPA verification, Section 8.2 "[Security Considerations](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-sidrops-aspa-verification/)")

## ASPA information send by BRIO rpki cache
This table only contains the ASPA information for routers in this experiment
| Customer     | Provider                  |

\+ Forged-origin and \+\+ forged-path-segment hijacks (path manipulations) by 
provider (E) towards customer (B) are undetectable by ASPA 
(See ASPA verification, Section 8.2 "[Security Considerations](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-sidrops-aspa-verification/)")

## Configuration 
The table below contains information about the configuration of brio_tg and IUT.
| Router                             | AS number (ID) | Update announcement |
| :--------------------------------- | :------------- | :-------------------|
| [IUT](exp910.router.tpl.md)        | 65010 (B)      | --                  | 
| [BRIO](exp910.brio_tg.as65040.tpl) | 65040 (E)      | 65000 (A)           |
|                                    |                | 65000 (A) 65020 (C) |

The IUT must be configured in passive mode. What this means is the router does 
not initiate the BGP connection request, the BRIO traffic generator ```brio_tg``` 
is responsible for session establishment.
